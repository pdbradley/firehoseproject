The methods assigned (the two reverse_list methods) are in the linked_list_helpers.rb file.

I added a to_s method to Stack and LinkedListNode just to make it easier to test.

The tests in the linked_list_spec.rb file should give some idea of whether these work or not.

% rspec linked_list_spec.rb


Thanks!  I enjoyed it.

If get up early enough tomorrow I'll work on that fancy problem with the repeating lists.
