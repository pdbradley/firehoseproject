The methods assigned (the two reverse_list methods) are in the linked_list_helpers.rb file.

I added a to_s method to Stack and LinkedListNode just to make it easier to test.

The tests in the linked_list_spec.rb file should give some idea of whether these work or not.

% rspec linked_list_spec.rb


Thanks!  I enjoyed it.

If get up early enough tomorrow I'll work on that fancy problem with the repeating lists.

(time passes...)

Okay, I did the Floyd Cycle Detection; once I realized you don't have to worry
about finding the length of the cycle, etc, it is pretty simple, unless I 
missed something.  Which is always possible.

Cheers!
